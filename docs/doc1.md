It's very simple, just send ETH to the SenseMinter contract

#### 1.  Phase One: initial minter
send 1 ~ 100 eth to the SenseMinter contract (0x123)  
you will get the Sense Token (0x123)  
the price is from 1000 SENSE/ETH to 2000 SENSE/ETH, depend on the ETH balance of the SenseMinter contract  

#### 2.  Phase Two:  claim LP token
when phase one end, all the ETH will send to the Uniswap SENSE/ETH pool   
first, rebase the sense token to 1 USD   
then mint corresponding Sense Tokens based on the ETH balance of the SenseMinter contract   
send the ETH and the sense token to the Uniswap SENSE/ETH pool and get the LP token   
the phase one participants can claim the LP token   

#### 3. Phase Three: vote for transfering ownership
the Sense token holder can vote for transfering the ownership of Sense Token.    
the owner of sense token can mint token.
