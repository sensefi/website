It's very simple, just send ETH to the SenseMinter contract

#### 1.  Phase One: initial minter
Send 1 ~ 100 eth to the SenseMinter contract [0x833f71b32d01a5d3e71473efe2d41a4bc65aec1c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x833f71b32d01a5d3e71473efe2d41a4bc65aec1c), consume about 78000 gas    
Get the Sense Token [0x7a7293e99aebdf8593a33dc26dd09f56f4ff0a3e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7a7293e99aebdf8593a33dc26dd09f56f4ff0a3e) with the price from 1000 SENSE/ETH to 2000 SENSE/ETH  

#### 2.  Phase Two:  claim LP token
